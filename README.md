# Inside-Hotel
A Desktop Application created using Python, MySQL and tkinter (GUI) in which staff can input the Check In details and Select rooms and accordingly price is calculated, to Check Out they enter name and room no. of the customer. K-means Clustering is applied to the dataset of customers to find patterns of city and state from where majority customers are visiting.

## Objective
The purpose of the project is to design and implement a Desktop Application using Python and Tkinter with real time database which help users/managers to manage their Hotel Bookings and help boost their business using the Machine Learning algorithm implemented.

## Technology Stack
1. Python
2. MySQL
3. Tkinter(GUI)
4. Machine Learning

## Major Functionalities
1. This application has 3 major features which are Check In, Check Out and Exit.
2. In Check In, the application allows user to enter customer’s data.
3. In Check In, the user can calculate total amount, and save customer’s details.
4. In Check Out, the user can delete record of the customer if customer’s stay period is over.
5. Exit closes the application.
6. MySQL database is used to operate on the data.
7. K-means Clustering is applied to customers database which locates the states from where major number of customers visit. This algorithm find patterns amongst the cities and list down top States from where maximum number of customers are visting.
8. This will be helpful in many ways such as implementing new marketing and advertising strategies, opening a franchise and revising hotel rooms price.
